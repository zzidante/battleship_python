# Battleship - Python Edition

## Based on Python introduction course challenge on Codecademy.
Program schematics differ as I added a function to repeat game play and players guess coordinates based on non-coders counting logic (guesses are 1 -5 instead of 0 - 4). 

## Single Player Text Game.  
Try to guess what the computer is thinking. Guess a number between 1 and 5 within 4 turns to win.
